# WPF Inventory Management System
This Simple Inventory Management System is a .NET WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) application developed using the .NET Framework and MySQL. The application provides a user-friendly interface to manage inventory data. It includes a home screen for quick inventory overview, an inventory page with categories and products tables, and a print page for generating printable reports.

## Features
- Home Screen: The application features a home screen that provides a quick view of the inventory. It displays essential information such as the total number of items in stock, low stock alerts, or any other relevant data.

- Inventory Page: The inventory page consists of two tabs - one for the categories table and another for the products table. Users can easily navigate between the tabs to manage and view the inventory.

- Categories Table: The categories table allows users to organize items into different categories. Users can add, delete, or edit categories to maintain a structured inventory.

- Products Table: The products table displays detailed information about each product, including name, description, quantity, and price. Users can add, delete, or edit products directly within the table, and the changes are reflected in real-time on both the categories and products tables.

- Print Page: The print page enables users to generate printable reports of the categories and products tables. Users can view a preview of the document before printing and add additional comments or notes. This feature facilitates easy documentation of inventory data and allows users to include relevant information alongside the printed report.

## Usage
Once the application is running, users can navigate through the different screens and perform various actions:

- Home Screen: Users can quickly review inventory statistics, low stock alerts, or any other relevant information displayed on the home screen.

- Inventory Page:

  - Categories Table: Users can view the overall count of the number of products in each category.
  - Products Table: Users can add, delete, or edit products directly within the table. Changes made to the products table are reflected in real-time on both the categories and products tables.
